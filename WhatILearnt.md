# What I learnt

## I understand GitHub now!
I used GitHub on the first Programming course. Back then I didn't knew about branches, pull and push, merging. I used this tool as a cloud storage where my teammates and I could access the code easily. Now I understand that GitHub is so much more than that, it's a version control system that allow us to work together although we're far away. 



## Still confused about...

Some things still are unclear to me. Mostly when it comes about merging the project, the collisions and what do to in those scenarios. Also how to create and edit the .gitignore document. I would really appreciate it if these questions could be answered in the next lesson!
